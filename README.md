# Node-Word-Guess
This is a terminal version of word-guess that uses Javascript, Node, and Inquirer.js to display prompts that users interact with. It's more of
a proof of concept as there are only five words currently included, which you should feel free to change. It should also be noted that currently,
as of the time of this writing, there is no user-input validation. That will come soon.

### Getting Started
To get started you should clone the repo to a desired location on your computer and use npm to install the required packages. In this instance
the only package required is 'inquirer'.

### Prerequisites
You will need Git Bash if your on Windows. You will also need Node regardless of what OS you are running.

### Installing
Windows Users:
1. Install Git Bash.
2. Clone the repo to desired folder.
3. Install Node.
4. In your Bash terminal navigate to the repo.
5. Run the main.js file through node. Ex: 'node main.js'
